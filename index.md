### Robo-CSK-Organizer: Enhancing Robotic Intelligence with Commonsense Knowledge

#### The Problem

Domestic robots often struggle with nuanced decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional AI systems lack the ability to understand commonsense knowledge (CSK) like humans, leading to inefficiencies and incorrect object placements. For instance, deciding whether a pear should be placed in the kitchen or the garden can be ambiguous, impacting the robot's usability and reliability in household tasks. Also, alothough models such as chat GPT exists that can emulate common sense to a degree, it's opaque box nature lacks the ability to explain its decisions. 


#### The Solution

  <figcaption>The Robo-CSK-Organizer addresses this challenge by integrating CSK from the ConceptNet knowledge base into the robot's decision-making process. This system leverages advanced AI technologies, including PyTorch for neural network models, DETIC for object detection, and BLIP for generating contextual understanding. By utilizing these technologies, the Robo-CSK-Organizer enhances the robot's ability to classify and organize objects accurately and explain its decisions to users.</figcaption>
